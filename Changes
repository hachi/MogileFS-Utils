  * Document return code behavior in the POD.

  * Provide specific return codes for list, listkey and locate when the item

  * Sometimes we get a - when we are expecting a numeric. Force these to zero.
  
  * Add locate task to mogtool that provides path output, useful in debugging.
  
  * Implement "device summary" per RT#3784. This provides an output with one
    line of storage data per host.

  * If there are hosts, but no devices, the totals were previously undefined,
    leading to errors in the output.
